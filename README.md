employee records. Each employee is uniquely identified by their Employee ID, which serves as
the key in the B+ Tree. The system supports the following operations:
1. Insertion: Add new employee records to the system.
2. Searching: Quickly find an employee by their ID.
3. Range Queries: Retrieve all employees within a specified range of IDs.
4. Deletion: Remove an employee record from the system.
5. Display: View all employee records in sorted order.
